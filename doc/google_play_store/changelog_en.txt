Version 2.0.0 (2014-12-12):
• Update for policy reasons (no functional changes to version 1.2.6)
• completly removed the "Donation" dialog as it violated Google's Content Policy and/or Developer Distribution Agreements (and lead to the expulsion of the app from the Play Store)
• new package ID for the app (so technically this is a <b>new app</b> and not just an update of the old app) because the old package ID stays bloccked permanently in Play Store (unfortunately)
• changed app name from "Bankomat Card Infos" to "Bankomat Card Infos 2"

Version 1.2.6 (2014-11-28):
• explain the field "cryptogram information data" in log entries
