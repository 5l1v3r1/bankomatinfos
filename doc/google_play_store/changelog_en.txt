Version 2.0.1 (2014-12-16):
• experimental support for analyzing Mastercard NFC cards
• experimental support for analyzing VISA NFC cards
• reading transaction log entries on creditcards might not work (yet)
• try to read some additional fields (using GET DATA)

Version 2.0.0 (2014-12-12):
• Update for policy reasons (no functional changes to version 1.2.6)
• completly removed the "Donation" dialog as it violated Google's Content Policy and/or Developer Distribution Agreements (and lead to the expulsion of the app from the Play Store)
• new package ID for the app (so technically this is a <b>new app</b> and not just an update of the old app) because the old package ID stays bloccked permanently in Play Store (unfortunately)
• changed app name from "Bankomat Card Infos" to "Bankomat Card Infos 2"
